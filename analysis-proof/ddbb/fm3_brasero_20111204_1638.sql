under apps/brasero/config/priority\n	- added group existence to plugins and a gconf key for favourite group\n	   now brasero tries to use plugins from the same group (most probably the favourite one if any)\n	- fix a bug where joliet option was hidden (see # )\n	- fix a bug where CDRW where appended instead of being blanked\n	- temporary fix for use of DAO (should be used only for first
